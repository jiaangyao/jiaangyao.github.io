I am a currently first-year PhD student in the [Joint Graduate Program in Bioengineering](https://bioegrad.berkeley.edu/) at [University of California,  Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/) and [University of California, San Francisco](https://www.ucsf.edu/) going through my lab rotations. My main researchs interests involve developing analysis and computational tools to study brain functions and to develop robust brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) for clinical applications.  

Prior to UC Berkeley and UCSF, I received my BA degree in [Biology](https://www.wesleyan.edu/bio/), [Mathematics](https://www.wesleyan.edu/mathcs/math/index.html) and [Neuroscience](https://www.wesleyan.edu/nsb/) at [Wesleyan University](https://www.wesleyan.edu/) and my BS degree in [Electrical Engineering](https://www.ee.columbia.edu/) at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/) through the [Combined Plan Joint BA/BS 3-2 Program](https://undergrad.admissions.columbia.edu/apply/combined-plan), before obtaining my MS degree in EE also at Columbia in 2021. At Columbia, I worked with [Paul Sajda](https://liinc.bme.columbia.edu/author/paulsajda/) on developing analysis tools for electroencephalography (EEG) and optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) data. I have also worked with [Jason Carmel](https://www.weinberg.cuimc.columbia.edu/research/movement-recovery-laboratory) at Columbia University Medical Center on analyzing electrocorticography (ECoG) data from rats. 

Outside of my studies and research, I watch a lot of anime/manga and want to start writing novel as a hobby when I am free. I also love to run for a lap or two in central park after a long day of work.
