I am currently a second-year PhD student in the [Graduate Program in Bioengineering](https://bioegrad.berkeley.edu/) at [University of California,  Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/) and [University of California, San Francisco](https://www.ucsf.edu/). My main research interests involve designing novel analysis and computational tools to study the brain and improving deep brain stimulation (DBS) for clinical applications. I am currently a member of the [Starr Lab](https://starrlab.ucsf.edu/) and the [Little Lab](https://littlelab.ucsf.edu/) at UCSF.

Prior to UC Berkeley and UCSF, I received my BA degree in [Biology](https://www.wesleyan.edu/bio/), [Mathematics](https://www.wesleyan.edu/mathcs/math/index.html), and [Neuroscience](https://www.wesleyan.edu/nsb/) at [Wesleyan University](https://www.wesleyan.edu/) and my BS degree in [Electrical Engineering](https://www.ee.columbia.edu/) at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/) in 2020 through the [Combined Plan Joint BA/BS 3-2 Program](https://undergrad.admissions.columbia.edu/apply/combined-plan). I subsequently obtained my MS degree in EE also at Columbia in 2021 through the [Integrated BS/MS Program](https://www.ee.columbia.edu/integrated-ee-bsms-program). At Columbia, I worked with [Paul Sajda](https://liinc.bme.columbia.edu/author/paulsajda/) on developing analysis tools for electroencephalography (EEG) and optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) data. I also worked with [Jason Carmel](https://www.weinberg.cuimc.columbia.edu/research/movement-recovery-laboratory) at [Columbia University Irving Medical Center](https://www.cuimc.columbia.edu/) on analyzing electrocorticography (ECoG) data recorded in rats and developing closed-loop system for spinal cord stimulation. 

Outside of research, I watch a lot of anime/manga and write online novels during my free time. I also used to jog in central park and riverside park when I was in NYC and am now trying to explore the jogging tracks in SF.
