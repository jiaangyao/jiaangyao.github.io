My main research interests lie in the field of neuroengineering and focus on brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and their applications. I am particularly interested in the field of neurorehabilitation for patients with tetraplegia, stroke as well as other disorders and the restoration of motor or speech functionalities in these patients using BCI devices.

I'm also interested in gaining more knowledge on the various machine learning and convex optimization techniques since they can be very useful for solving challenging problems in neuroengineering. In particular, I'm very interested in disciplines such as deep learning, Bayesian modeling, as well sparse models.
